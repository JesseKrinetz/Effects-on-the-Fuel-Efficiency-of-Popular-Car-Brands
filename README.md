# Effects-on-the-Fuel-Efficiency-of-Popular-Car-Brands
This project analyzes how various vehicle attributes influence highway fuel efficiency. Using multiple linear regression modeling, we identify which factors — such as engine displacement, cylinder count, drive type, and fuel type — most strongly affect miles per gallon (MPG) performance across popular car brands.
